# Final Project for Database Class
Final project for database systems class at Lewis University. A simple practice framework using Fairmont project I've already done as inspiration but turned it into a new project using PHP and MySQL instead of node.js and MongoDB. This project can be ran locally using XAMPP or MAMP using an Apache server, I also hosted it on AWS instead of Azure like for the other projects. This wasnâ€™t a team-based project, so I was responsible for all the code.
